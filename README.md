# Aim
The aim of this project is to create a comprehensive and interactive dashboard using Power BI to analyze and visualize Blinkit's sales performance, outlet characteristics, and customer preferences. The dashboard provides key insights into total sales, average sales, number of items sold, and customer satisfaction, along with detailed analysis based on outlet size, location, and item categories.

# Objective
1. Sales Insights: Analyze total and average sales across various item types, outlets, and locations.
2. Outlet Analysis: Understand the distribution of outlet establishments over time, outlet sizes, and how location influences sales.
3. Customer Behavior: Study the fat content preferences of customers and their impact on sales in different outlet tiers.
4. Performance Metrics: Monitor key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total sales, average sales per transaction, number of items sold, and average customer ratings.
5. Outlet Types: Compare the performance of different types of supermarkets and grocery stores in terms of sales, items sold, and ratings.

# Project Learnings:
1. Data Cleaning and Preparation: Data from Blinkit was cleaned and pre-processed to ensure it was suitable for analysis. Missing values were handled, and relevant KPIs were defined.
2. Data Visualization: Utilized various Power BI visualizations such as line charts, bar charts, pie charts, and tables to represent the data clearly and effectively.
3. Interactive Filtering: Implemented interactive filters such as Outlet Location, Outlet Size, and Item Type to allow users to explore the data from multiple angles.
4. KPI Calculations: Developed custom measures for calculating total sales, average sales, number of items, and average ratings to provide a comprehensive view of performance.
5. Data Segmentation: Segmenting data based on outlet size, location, item types, and fat content for targeted analysis and insights.

# Conclusion:
The Blinkit dashboard provides a holistic view of sales and outlet performance across multiple dimensions. By analyzing the data, the company can gain valuable insights into customer preferences, outlet performance, and product sales. The interactive features allow decision-makers to drill down into specific aspects of the data, making it easier to identify trends, opportunities, and areas for improvement. This dashboard will serve as a critical tool for optimizing sales strategies and improving customer satisfaction.
